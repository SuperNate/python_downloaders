==================

A threadedd and non-threaded file downloading script in Python

These scripts were born from boredom while studying for an exam. I could either download all the lecture pdfs one-by-one or I could write a script to do it for me. I chose the latter. Then I realized I hadn't ever played with Python threads before, and so the threaded version of the script was born.
